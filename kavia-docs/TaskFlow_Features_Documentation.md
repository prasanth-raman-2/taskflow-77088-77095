# TaskFlow Task Manager: Features Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the features and user-facing functionalities implemented in the TaskFlow Task Manager application. The documentation summarizes the core capabilities of the application based on analysis of the current implementation.

## Overview

TaskFlow Task Manager is a lightweight, responsive web application built with React that enables users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application provides an intuitive interface for creating, viewing, and organizing tasks, with persistent storage in the browser's local storage.

## Core Features

### Task Management

#### Task Creation
- **Add Task Form**: Users can create new tasks by clicking the "+ Add New Task" button, which expands to reveal a form with the following fields:
  - Title (required): A short name or description for the task
  - Description (optional): Additional details about the task
  - Due Date (optional): When the task should be completed
- **Form Validation**: The application validates that a title is provided before allowing task creation
- **Submission**: Tasks are created by clicking the "Add Task" button, which adds the task to the list and collapses the form

#### Task Viewing
- **Task List**: All tasks are displayed in a list format showing:
  - Task title
  - Abbreviated description
  - Due date
  - Current status
- **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by status using a dropdown menu:
  - All tasks
  - Pending tasks
  - In-progress tasks
  - Completed tasks
- **Task Sorting**: Tasks are automatically sorted by creation date (newest first)

#### Task Details
- **Details Modal**: Clicking on any task opens a modal displaying comprehensive information:
  - Full title
  - Complete description
  - Current status with visual indicator
  - Due date with formatted timestamp
  - Creation date with formatted timestamp
- **Modal Dismissal**: Users can close the details modal by clicking the "âœ•" button

### Status Management

- **Status Options**: Each task can have one of three status states:
  - Pending: Tasks that have not been started
  - In-progress: Tasks currently being worked on
  - Completed: Tasks that have been finished
- **Status Updates**: Users can change a task's status directly from the task list using a dropdown menu
- **Visual Indicators**: Different status types are represented with distinct colors:
  - Pending: Amber/yellow
  - In-progress: Blue
  - Completed: Green

### Task Deletion

- **Delete Functionality**: Users can delete tasks using the "Delete" button on each task item
- **Confirmation**: A confirmation dialog appears before deletion to prevent accidental removal of tasks

### Data Persistence

- **Local Storage**: All task data is automatically saved to the browser's local storage
- **Data Retrieval**: When the application loads, it retrieves previously saved tasks from local storage
- **Auto-save**: Any changes to tasks (creation, status changes, deletion) are automatically saved

## User Interface

### Navigation

- **Navbar**: A fixed navigation bar at the top of the application with:
  - TaskFlow logo and branding
  - Navigation links (Tasks is active by default, while Dashboard and Projects are placeholders for future functionality)

### Layout

- **Responsive Design**: The application's layout adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Task Manager Section**: Contains the add task form and task list
- **Container Structure**: Content is centered and constrained to a maximum width for readability

### Visual Design

- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with orange accent color (Kavia branding)
- **Task Cards**: Individual tasks displayed with subtle background and hover effects
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators provide visual cues about task progress

## Interaction Flow

1. **Initial Load**: User is presented with the task list and "+ Add New Task" button
2. **Task Creation**: User clicks the button, fills in task details, and submits the form
3. **Task Management**: User can:
   - View all tasks in the list
   - Filter tasks by status
   - Select a task to view detailed information
   - Update a task's status via dropdown
   - Delete tasks as needed

## Technical Implementation Notes

The application is built using:
- **React**: For the UI component architecture
- **React Context API**: For global state management of tasks
- **Browser Local Storage**: For data persistence
- **Custom CSS**: For styling (no external UI libraries)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

While not yet implemented, the application's structure suggests planned features such as:
- Dashboard for task analytics
- Project management functionality
- User accounts and authentication
- Task sharing capabilities
- Advanced filtering and sorting options

This documentation reflects the current implementation of the TaskFlow Task Manager application as of the analysis date.
